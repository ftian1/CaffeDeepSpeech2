# CaffeDeepSpeech2
The caffe implementation of DeepSpeech2

It's a minimal version of caffe deep speech2. I dropped out many bn1d layers as caffe doesn't support it yet.

TODO LIST:
1. variable length support -- depends on caffe implementation
2. batch normal 1d support -- same as above
3. bidirection support -- same as above
4. gru support -- same as above
